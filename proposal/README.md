<!-- /code_chunk_output -->

<!-- In less than 2 pages, propose a topic in object-oriented design as your project.  Your proposal must include (but not be limited to) the following sections: 
• Project title 
• Team #, team members 
• Team members working on the proposal 
• State the problem/issue to resolve 
• If applicable, briefly survey previous works if any (include references) 
• If applicable, describe assumptions / operating environments / intended usage 
• High-level description of your solution which may include (but is not limited to), your plan and approach.  Be as specific as possible. 
• Functionality: describe how your solution tackles the issues 
• Operations: List operations for each intended user (in list format).  Be precise and specific. 
• (Optional) References: must include citations in content using the format [1], [2], etc. 
Be mindful that we are using java. So we're probably gonna be doing spring boot and JavaFX app-->

## Team Members working on the proposal

- Mohamed Halim (Group Leader)
- Huu Hung Nguyen
- Diego Quezada
- Ngoc Ly Tran

## State the problem/issue to resolve
- The problem we are trying to solve is to create a weather app that can display the weather of a city. The app will be able to display the current weather, the weather for the next 5 days, and the weather for the next 24 hours. This included the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the weather condition. The app will also be updated every 10 minutes to display the most recent weather information. 


## Briefly survey previous works if any (include references)

Multiple weather applications, such as AccuWeather, Weather Underground, and The Weather Channel app, provide extensive weather data but may lack personalized user experiences or intuitive alert systems [AccuWeather].


## Approach

The team is going to build a spring boot api that manages the back-side of the application, while accessing that through a JavaFX application.
